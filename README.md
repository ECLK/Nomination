# System for Nominating Candidates for Elections

The nomination system is used to nominate candidates for an election. This system also covers the earlier step of registering a political party (which spans multiple elections) or an independent group for a particular election.

Note that as of November 2018, the legally binding nomination process requires paper submission of nominations. This system helps a party or independent group prepare the nomination form and validate that the data is correct.
